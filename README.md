# Foodgram

The **Foodgram** project is a platform that allows users to share their recipes.

## Overview

The foodgram platform implements all the basic functionality inherent in projects of this kind.

Users can:
- register and create recipes
- subscribe to other users, thus forming their own recipe feed
- filter recipes by tags
- add recipes to favorites and shopping list (which can be downloaded as a txt file)

In addition, the Foodgram project has CI/CD which is implemented via using the Github Actions, so when push happens, the code is automatically tested and deployed to a remote server.

## Technologies

## Examples of API requests

### User registration algorithm

1. The user sends a POST request to add a new user with the following parameters: email, password, username, first_name, last_name to the /api/users/ endpoint.
2. The user sends a POST request to receive a token for authentication to the api/token/login/ endpoint.

### API root endpoint (links to resources available in the API):

[http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/](http://localhost/api/)

Detailed description is in [Documentation](http://localhost/api/docs/).

### Commands to launch the project in Docker containers:
```bash
1. `docker-compose up -d --build` - building/rebuilding containers
2. `winpty docker-compose exec django python manage.py makemigrations` - creating migrations
3. `winpty docker-compose exec django python manage.py migrate` - making migration
4. `winpty docker-compose exec django python manage.py createsuperuser` - creation of superuser
5. `winpty docker-compose exec django python manage.py collectstatic --no-input` - collecting static files
6. `docker-compose down -v` - stopping the container and removing dependecies
```

## Project status

At the moment, it is planned to remove SerializerMethodField from sterilizers and search for a more correct and "beautiful" solution.
